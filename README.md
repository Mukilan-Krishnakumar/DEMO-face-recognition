# Image search using RESNET50 model

This example application spins up a Weaviate instance using the
[img2vec-neural](https://github.com/semi-technologies/i2v-pytorch-models)
module, imports a few sample images (you can add your own images, too!) and
provides a very simple search frontend in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using
the [Weaviate JS Client
](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/client-libraries/javascript.html)

It is a minimal example using only few images, but you can add any amount of
images yourself!

## Prerequisites to run it yourself
- Docker & Docker-Compose
- Bash
- Node.js and npm/yarn if you also want to run the frontend

## Run it yourself

The easiest way to start and stop the demo is to use the `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts.

To start the demo issue: `bash start.sh`.

To stop the demo issue: `bash stop.sh`.

Directory `look_for` contains similar images of faces used in the demo (generated by [generated.photos](https://generated.photos)) that you can use to drag & drop them into the search area to perform similarity searches.

## How to run with your own images

Simply create a subfolder in `./images` folder. Place your image in subfolder and create `name.txt` file and put a name there prior running the import
script. The script looks for `.jpg` file ending, but Weaviate supports other
image types as well, you can adopt those if you like.
